            <p> Where do I begin?  The flight was long but it was well worth it.  My 1st stop was in Melbourne.  My first impression of the city was am I in Boston?
            Except the fact that people seem much more friendlier, and willing to help me with directions.  I had a chance to pet Kangaroos (see background pictures).
            They were friendly and the young kangaroos were much friendlier.  They were willing to come up close to me so I can feed them.  After countless hours of fun,
            getting lost, amazed by the beauty of Melbourne, I was on my way to the next leg of the trip to Sydney.  </p>

           <p> Looking back I realized, I was pretty much visited NY and Boston version of the cities across the contient.  Sydney reminded me of the Big Apple.  With so 
            many people heading to their destinations with less friendlier version of Melbourne.  The city itself seems reflection of NY.  After trying to figured out
            my way to numerous stops supposedly all the tourist goes, I discovered something about myself.  I the woman who have no sense of direction can travel. </p>
