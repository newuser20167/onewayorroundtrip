            <h1> <font color="black">  <em> <font size="5"> Greetings!  I always wanted to travel growing up but never had a chance to.  Let's just say didn't know where to begin.
                You may think it is odd that someone doesn't know where to begin.  Yes, that was me then.  I didn't know how to book a ticket, hotel, and unknown
                places scared me.  I didn't have anyone to go with either or can asked for advices.  All that changed when I finished college.  Yes, aside from getting
                on a plane to come to the US, I didn't travel at all growing up.  A friend of mine at that time, invited me to my first Carribean trip.  St. Martin to
                be exact.  I had a great time.  I found out so much about myself.  Traveling gave me freedom, confident that I need it.  Since after that, I promise 
                myself I will try to go at least 2 places a year that I never been to.  Some years, I kept my promise.  Other years, it was more like close by out of
                town trip.  I still enjoy it.  When you leave a place you live for so long, it gave you a chance to appreciate more of your surrounding. </em> </font> </h1>
